Description: This package includes a function `AIPWmeasures` that calculates standard measures of predictive accuracy commonly used in biomarker validation studies. More specifically, this function calculates estimates using data from two-phase sampling designs ('case-cohort' and 'nested case-control') using two different methods, a standard ipw estimator (true ipw) and a novel method (augmented ipw) that has been shown to be more efficient in some contexts. See the manuscript "Improving Efficiency in Biomarker Incremental Value Evaluation under Two-phase Study Designs" by Zheng et. al. for more details.
